Feature: Worklist
  Agents ask the server what to work on next, and no two agents work the same entry at once.

  @work/gaps @domain
  Scenario: A claim names what the entry lacks
    Given an entry and its facts in every status
    When the gaps are computed from its pending and published facts
    Then each missing senses, forms, or pronunciation is a gap, and each live sense without relations, examples, or a zh translation is a gap

  @work/claim-order @usecase
  Scenario: The least recently worked live entry is claimed first
    Given entries never worked, entries worked earlier, and entries whose entry fact is rejected or retracted
    When an agent claims work
    Then it gets a never-worked entry first, oldest first, then the least recently worked, and never a dead entry

  @work/claim-lease @usecase
  Scenario: A claimed entry is leased to one agent
    Given an agent holds the lease on the only live entry
    When another agent claims work before the lease expires
    Then nothing is claimable, and after the lease expires the other agent gets the entry

  @work/complete @usecase
  Scenario: Only the holder completes its lease, once
    Given an agent holds a lease
    When another agent completes it, the lease expired, or the holder completes it twice
    Then the other agent and the expired lease get conflict, and the repeat gets not_found

  @work/claim-api @api
  Scenario: Claim and complete over HTTP
    Given a submitted entry
    When an agent claims work, another agent claims or completes, and the holder completes with a note
    Then the claim returns the lease, the management entry view, and its gaps; the other agent gets 204 and 409; a repeated complete is 404

  @work/claim-race @api
  Scenario: Concurrent claims get distinct entries
    Given several live entries
    When agents claim work at the same moment
    Then each claim gets a different entry, and the claims beyond the entry count get no content

  @work/lease-expiry-api @api
  Scenario: An expired lease is claimable again and cannot be completed
    Given an agent whose lease has expired
    When the first agent completes its lease and another agent claims work
    Then the first agent gets 409 conflict and the other agent gets the entry
